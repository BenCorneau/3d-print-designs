# 3d-print-designs

Custom things I've designed to 3D print.  I've just discovered https://www.openscad.org/ and these designs are modeled using it.  Open SCAD is great 3D modeling tool if you have any coding experince.  This is my first attempt working with Open SCAD.

The `scad` files are the source designs.  Open SCAD can export `stl` files.  Those are the files used for 3D printing and are included as well.

Object 1: Wall mount for chromebook power suply

Object 2: Wall mounted cup holder for dog treats
